# DevServices Agency

You can access the application locally at http://localhost:5000, or remotely - it is currently running on https://dev-services.herokuapp.com/

## Registration

The **Register**-link is found in the top right-hand corner.

Enter the required information into the form fields. The form uses error messages to prompt you in case any of the inputs do not meet the required input-validation requirements. Fix these as necessary. A successful registration will result in you being automatically directed to the login page. You have now registered a client account.

## Log in

You can access the application's services when logged in. This can be done by register as described above. You may also use a test account to log in without registration. The credentials for this account are the following:

| USERNAME | PASSWORD | ROLE |
| -------- | -------- | ---- |
| client   | password | N/A  |

This account provides access to all of the application's functionality.

## Log out

To **Logout**, simply click the logout link located in the top right-hand corner. The link is only shown to logged in accounts.
